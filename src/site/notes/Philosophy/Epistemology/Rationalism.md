#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Rationalism is the philosophical position that knowledge is primarily attained through reasoning. While rationalists accept that empirical investigation can provide us with knowledge, they believe that there is some knowledge that is obtained/justified through reason alone. In contrast to empiricists, rationalists argue that [[Philosophy/Epistemology/A Priori vs A Posteriori Knowledge\|a priori knowledge]] exists and is non-trivial.

In contrast to [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Empiricism\|Empiricism]], rationalism primarily relies on [[Philosophy/Logic/Deductive Reasoning\|Deductive Reasoning]] in deriving knowledge. This gives rationalism an advantage over empiricism since deductive reasoning can provide complete certainty in the truth of a priori knowledge.

Examples of famous rationalist philosophers include:
- Rene Descartes
