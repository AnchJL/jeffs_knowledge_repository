## Disagreement as Defeaters of Knowledge

Consensus can provide at least some reassurance that our beliefs are true. It is no guarantee, however, since it could always be the case that everyone who agrees with a particular belief is wrong. For example, most of the world seemed to agree that the sun revolved around the earth at one point in history; now we know they were all wrong. Nonetheless, agreement is comforting and provide us with some level of confidence in our beliefs.

In contrast, disagreement can make us question whether our beliefs are true. In the modern era, social media has massively increased our exposure to views contrary to our own. This is not necessarily bad since exposure to different viewpoints can help us arrive at the truth by allowing us to evaluate and scrutinize multiple different perspectives.

A bad thing about disagreement is that it can prevent us from having knowledge. There are two ways in which this can happen:
1. **Disagreement causes us to abandon a true belief**
	- For example: suppose Bob originally thought the climate change was being largely driven by human activity. However, there is significant disagreement in the media as to whether climate change is real or is exacerbated by humans. When Bob encounters this disagreement in the media, this causes him to lose confidence in his original belief, thus preventing him from knowing that climate change is being primarily caused by human activity.
2. **Disagreement acts as a *defeater* by convincing us we do not  have good reasons for our true beliefs**
	- For example: suppose Bob initially believed that the first moon landing occurred back in 1969 because he had learned it from his history textbook. However, Bill disagreed with Bob and told him that the first moon landing was actually in 1968. This causes Bob to doubt his reasons for his original belief, preventing him from having knowledge. Thus, Bill's disagreement acted as a *defeater* to Bob's knowledge.

## Faultless Disagreement

Faultless disagreement occurs when two or more parties are entitled to hold on to their beliefs. Faultless disagreement typically occurs in matters of taste or subjective preference. For example, Bob and Sandy can disagree on whether a given film was good or bad without either of them being in the wrong. A reason for this is because there is no fact of the matter on whether a film is good or bad, and so one cannot know if a film is good or bad.

In contrast, disagreement on matters of fact always involve fault on one of the parties. For example, when lay people disagree with medical experts on medical issues, the former would typically at fault for disagreeing since being a medical expert gives one better epistemic standing on medical issues.

Aesthetic judgements seem to be a matter of subjective preferences, and would thus allow for faultless disagreement. This is, however, contrary to the idea that people can improve their aesthetic judgments or the idea that there can be experts on aesthetic matters. For instance, the opinions of a professional film critic are held in high regard when it comes to determining whether a movie is good and worth watching. But if lay people are not at fault for disagreeing with the aesthetic judgements of experts then the opinions of aesthetic experts are not necessarily better, which undermines the concept of being an expert in this domain.

The above issues of faultless disagreement for aesthetic judgements also apply to moral and political judgements as well.

## Peer Disagreement

Peer disagreement occurs when two people who disagree are *epistemic peers*, which are individuals who have the same levels of intelligence and they possess all the same information relevant to the case at hand. In other words, epistemic peers are epistemically equal.

## Expert Disagreement

Even when we disagree with experts, we should generally defer to their judgement when it comes to their fields of expertise because they have greater knowledge within that field than we do. An issue, however, is that even experts sometimes disagree with each other.

How we ought to respond to expert disagreement will depend on their field. If the subject of disagreement is on a matter of personal preferences, such as aesthetics, then we are allowed to believe whichever expert we want since aesthetics allows for faultless disagreement.
