#Philosophy/Religion 

**Fideism** is the position that religious beliefs are a matter of faith rather than reason. According to such a view, religious beliefs are outside of epistemic evaluation, meaning they concepts such as *evidence* and *knowledge* are inapplicable to religious beliefs. This renders religious beliefs neither rational or irrational. Nonetheless, fideists can still maintain that it can be right to have faith in religion despite having no rational support for it.
