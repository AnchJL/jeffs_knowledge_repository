#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Testimonial reductionism is one of the solutions to the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Testimony#The Problem with Testimony\|the problem of testimony]]. According to testimonial reductionism, you are justified in believing testimony if it is supported on non-testimonial grounds. As an example, Bob trusts his mom when she says that the local library is closed. Bob is justified in believing in the testimony of his mom because he has observed in the past that the testimony of his mom is often correct. 

However, this only works for *local* beliefs; Bob is justified in believing the testimony of things he can personally verify himself. Since the closed-status of the library is something that Bob can verify by visiting the library, this makes his belief that "the library is closed" is a local belief, which in turn can only be justified by other local beliefs.

For global beliefs, i.e. beliefs that he cannot easily and personally verify, it would seem that Bob does not have any non-testimonial grounds for them and therefore would not be justified in believing them.
