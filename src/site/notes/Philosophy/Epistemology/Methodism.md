#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Methodism is one of the two philosophical approaches to the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Problem of the Criterion\|Problem of the Criterion]]. Methodism seeks to address the problem by arguing that the criterion of knowledge must be first established before we can figure out what examples of belief count as knowledge. One famous Methodist is Rene Descartes, who argues that clear and distinct ideas are what count as knowledge.
