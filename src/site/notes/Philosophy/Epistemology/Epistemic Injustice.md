#Philosophy/Epistemology 

The concept of epistemic injustice was first introduced by Miranda Fricker in her book, *Epistemic Injustice: The Power and The Ethics of Knowing*. There are two categories of epistemic injustice according to Fricker:
1. Hermeneutical injustice
2. Testimonial injustice

## Hermeneutical Injustice

Hermeneutical injustice refers to how social structures can prevent people from properly knowing and identifying that they are in an unjust situation. 

A common example of this is how the concept of sexual harassment only came about recently in the 1970s. Prior to that, people who faced unwanted sexual advances in their workplace would have lacked the conceptual resources to articulate the problem they were facing. The reason why the concept of sexual harassment came about in the 1970s and not earlier is because there were disproportionately fewer women in the workplace where knowledge of such a concept would have been important. The prior injustice of women being underrepresented in many professions leads to the epistemic injustice where people do not have the conceptual tools to understand and communicate the oppression they are facing.

## Testimonial Injustice

Testimonial injustice occurs when people dismiss or distrust someone's [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Testimony\|Testimony]] due to prejudice. An example of this would be how women's contributions are regularly downgraded and hence their testimony is regarded as less credible than their male colleagues.

Testimonial injustice is an epistemic problem for two reasons.
1. It unjustly treats disadvantaged groups as ignorant even when they have knowledge. Conversely, it treats advantaged groups as knowers even when they do not deserve to be.
2. It can undermine the confidence of people from disadvantaged groups in their own beliefs. This can result in people to lack beliefs in propositions that they are well-suited to know, and therefore prevent themselves from having knowledge (since belief is a required for knowledge).
