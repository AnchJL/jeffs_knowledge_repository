#Philosophy/Epistemology 
Contextualism is a response to [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Skepticism\|Skepticism]] that argues that the meaning of “knowledge” is context sensitive. Examples of context sensitive words include “tall” or “yesterday”. Whether something is tall will depend on the relevant context. Having a height of 6’ is tall for the average man (where the average height is 5’9”) but is short for an NBA player (where the average height of an NBA player is 6’7”). Likewise, “yesterday” can refer to different days depending on which day of the week it currently is. Contextualists argue that the word “knowledge” works in a similar manner.

Contextualism attempts to salvage the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Relevant Alternatives Theory of Knowledge\|Relevant Alternatives Theory of Knowledge]] without abandoning epistemic closure. The scope of relevant alternatives to consider will vary depending on the context. In ordinary circumstances, we typically do not consider men in realistic animal costumes to be a relevant alternative for explaining why see an animal in the distance. Therefore, we can say Bob knows there is a moose in the distance based on the low standards of ordinary casual speech. In the context of skepticism, we use higher standards for what counts as knowledge and so we consider the possibility that the moose is two men in a costume as a relevant alternative. Therefore, skeptics can say that Bob does not know there is a moose in the distance. If we do not use two different standards for knowledge in the same context, then there is no conflict between what the skeptic says and what ordinary people would say about what Bob knows.

## Criticism

A criticism of contextualism is that it is essentially another form of skepticism. Contextualism concedes that in the context of using the highest standards for knowledge, then skepticism is correct. However, radical skepticism does not contend that are basis for knowledge is good but not good enough. Rather, radical skepticism maintains that we have no good basis for claiming we have knowledge.

In contrast to contextualism, the position that argues that knowledge is context-independent is [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Invariantism\|Invariantism]].
