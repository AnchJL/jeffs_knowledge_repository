#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Religious knowledge refers to knowing things such as existence and nature of a deity. Unlike other forms of knowledge, the existence of religious knowledge is controversial.

The first argument against the existence of religious knowledge is to argue that there are no religious truths, and since truth is prerequisite for knowledge, it would follow that religious knowledge could not exist. For example, God is the central subject matter of theistic religions. If God does not exist, then it would follow that theistic religions cannot be true, and so a theist cannot have religious knowledge.

A second argument against the existence of religious knowledge is that even if there are religious truths, belief in them would not amount to knowledge because there is a lack of evidence in favour of these beliefs. This objection to religious knowledge is called the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Evidentiary Challenge to Religious Knowledge\|Evidentiary Challenge to Religious Knowledge]].
