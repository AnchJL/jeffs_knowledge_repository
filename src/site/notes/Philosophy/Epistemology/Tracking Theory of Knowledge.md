#Philosophy/Epistemology 

The tracking theory of knowledge was proposed by the American philosopher, Robert Nozick, in response to the problem posed by [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Gettier Cases\|Gettier Cases]]. According to Nozick's tracking theory, an agent S knows P if and only if all of the conditions below are met:
1. P is true
2. S believes that P
3. If P was not true, then S would not believe that P
4. If P was true, then S would believe that P

Notice that S having internal knowledge of the justification for P is not a requirement. This makes the tracking theory of knowledge an [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Epistemic Externalism\|externalist]] theory of knowledge.
## Problems with the Tracking Theory

Nozick saw that a potential problem with his tracking theory is that the methods we use to form our beliefs can be weirdly entangled with the truth of said beliefs. He uses the following example to illustrate this point: suppose that a grandmother is bedridden and her grandson comes to visit her. The grandmother infers that her grandson is healthy from looking at his appearance and the fact that he is well enough to show up in person. However, if the boy had been unwell, his family would have lied to the grandma and told her that he was fine and she would believe them. This seems to violate the third condition of the tracking theory; the proposition that the grandson is well would have been false but the grandmother would have believed he was anyway. However, this counterfactual seems to have no bearing on whether the grandmother has knowledge in the current situation given that she can clearly see that her grandson is feeling well.

In response to this problem, Nozick proposed that the tracking theory should make explicit reference to a method of belief-formation. The grandmother's method of belief formation, which looking at her grandson by the bedside, is actually a truth-tracking method and is not affected by the family's secret plan to hide their son in case he gets sick. If the boy was sick, and his family kept him at home and lied to the grandmother about his health then the grandmother would have to rely on a different method of belief formation that would have been unable to track the truth  in this context: relying on the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Testimony\|Testimony]] of her family.

Since Nozick's theory relies on having the right method of belief formation, this makes his theory susceptible to the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Reliabilism#The Generality Problem\|Generality Problem]].
