#Philosophy/Epistemology

The causal theory of knowledge was proposed by Alvin Goldman in 1967 to address the challenge posed by [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Gettier Cases\|Gettier Cases]]. According to this theory, an agent S knows proposition in if all of the below conditions are satisfied:
1. P is true
2. S believes P
3. P is causally connected to S's belief in P in the appropriate way

Notice that this new theory of knowledge does not require S to be justified in believing P. The causal theory of knowledge is an example of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Epistemic Externalism\|Epistemic Externalism]].
## Example of the Causal Theory of Knowledge in Action

To see how this new definition of knowledge addresses the Gettier problem, consider the following Gettier case. Bob sees muffins on display through the window of a bakery and infers that the bakery has a batch of muffins ready for sale. However, the muffins on the display window were fake plastic models. It just so happened that the bakery actually did have a fresh batch of muffins for sale when Bob looked at the display. Most people intuitively feel that Bob did not know the bakery had muffins available for sale, even though Bob satisfied all the conditions for knowledge under the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Justified True Belief\|Justified True Belief]] model. According to the causal theory of knowledge, Bob did not know there were muffins for sale because the truth of there being muffins for sale was not causally related to his belief that there were muffins for sale. What caused Bob's belief instead was the fake muffins in the window display.
## Problems with the Causal Theory of Knowledge

Although the causal theory of knowledge seemed to address the Gettier problem, it was later abandoned by Goldman. Goldman gave the following example for why the causal theory of knowledge was flawed. Suppose Henry is driving through the countryside with his son and saw hundreds of barns along the way. Henry points to one of the barns and says "Look, son! That's a barn!" The catch here is that Henry is driving through a county where everyone likes to play pranks and construct hundreds of fake barn cut outs to deceive drivers. It just so happened that the particular barn Henry pointed at was the only real barn in the vicinity. All three conditions of the causal theory of knowledge are satisfied: it is true that particular barn is real, Henry believes that it is a real barn, and the truth that it is a real barn is causally connected to his belief that it is a real barn. Nonetheless, Goldman argues that Henry does not know that the barn he is pointing to is real. Goldman's explanation was that in ordinary circumstances, Henry would have been very unlikely to have pointed his finger at a real barn; it just so happened that he did. In other words, Henry would not have been reliable in picking out the real barn from the rest. This leads us to Goldman's subsequent [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Reliabilism\|reliabilist theory of knowledge]].
