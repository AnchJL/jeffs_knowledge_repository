#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Empiricism is the philosophical belief that our knowledge is primarily gained through our sensory experiences with the world (or empirical investigation). Knowledge that is gained or justified in this way is known as a [[Philosophy/Epistemology/A Priori vs A Posteriori Knowledge\|posteriori knowledge]]. In contrast to rationalists, empiricists argue against the existence of a priori knowledge or argue that a priori knowledge is not substantive.

While rationalists rely on [[Philosophy/Logic/Deductive Reasoning\|Deductive Reasoning]] to derive a priori knowledge, empiricists primarily rely on [[Philosophy/Logic/Inductive Reasoning\|Inductive Reasoning]] to derive much of our knowledge. While inductive reasoning is the basis for scientific inquiry and scientific knowledge, induction does not provide complete certainty in the truth of our beliefs.
