#Philosophy/Epistemology 
## The Instrumental Value of Knowledge

What is the value in having knowledge? One answer to that question is that having knowledge is useful for reaching our goals. To give an example, suppose that I want to get to work on time. If I wanted to avoid being late for work then I would have to know what time my shift starts. In situations where knowledge is required to attain some other thing that we value, knowledge is said to be *instrumentally valuable*.

## Limitations to Instrumental Value

One limitation to the argument that knowledge is instrumentally valuable is that not all knowledge is useful. For example, knowing how many grains of sand are at the beach is not useful for the goals of most people. Knowledge of trivial or inconsequential facts tend to not have any instrumental value.

Another limitation is there may be instances where a false belief would be more instrumentally valuable than a true belief. One example is that Bob has to make a dangerous jump across a dangerous ravine in order to escape an approaching bear. It is vital that Bob believes that he can successfully jump across the ravine because:
1. Not believing would prevent him from making the jump, leaving Bob to fend for himself against a bear
2. Being confident in his ability will improve his chances of successfully jumping across the ravine

Given those two reasons above, it would be beneficial for Bob to believe he can jump to the other side despite having no justification for that belief.

A major challenge in epistemology is arguing why knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief if they both can equally be used to achieve our goals. This issue is known as the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Swamping Problem\|Swamping Problem]].
## Intrinsic Value of Knowledge

To say that knowledge has intrinsic value is to say that it is good to have knowledge *for its own sake*. People are driven by curiosity to learn new things, even if the knowledge they acquire is not obviously useful. While both knowledge and mere true belief have instrumental value, it would seem that knowledge can be valuable on its own whereas mere true belief would *lack* any intrinsic value.
