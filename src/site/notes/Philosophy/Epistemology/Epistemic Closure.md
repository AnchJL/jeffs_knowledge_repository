#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Epistemic closure is the idea that a person knowing a proposition and what it entails means that they know the entailed propositions. To put it more simply:
1. Person S knows P
2. S knows that P entails Q
3. Therefore, S knows Q
Here is an example of epistemic closure:
1. I know that Bob is from Paris
2. I know that entails Bob is from France
3. Therefore, I know that Bob is from France
