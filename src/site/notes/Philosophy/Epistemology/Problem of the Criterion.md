#Philosophy/Epistemology 

The problem of the criterion has been a philosophical subject that dates back to antiquity, it was popularized in the 20th century by the American philosopher, Roderick Chisholm. 

The problem of the criterion concerns how we are able to define the criteria for what counts as knowledge. We could study individual examples of knowledge and examine any similarities among them to determine a criteria for what counts as knowledge. Example cases where we would say an individual has knowledge would include a scientist knowing the results of an experiment or an eye witness knowing who committed a crime. However, identifying particular cases where an individual has knowledge requires knowing the criteria that would qualify these cases as knowledge. 

In contrast, we could reflect on what the criteria for knowledge should be first in order to identify individual instances of knowledge. However, how do we go about developing a good criteria for knowledge? We cannot appeal to any particular examples of knowledge to define the criteria because that would require knowing the criteria, which is what we are trying to figure out in the first place. 

The task of defining knowledge has become a circular problem that can be summarized by the following two sentences:
1. You cannot identify any examples of knowledge without determining the criteria for knowledge
2. You cannot determine the criteria for knowledge without identifying any examples of knowledge

There have been two ways of addressing this problem:
- [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Methodism\|Methodism]]
- [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Particularism\|Particularism]]

The [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Justified True Belief\|Justified True Belief]] account of knowledge was eventually settled on as the standard criteria for awhile until the introduction of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Gettier Cases\|Gettier Cases]].
