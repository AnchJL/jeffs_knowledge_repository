#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Particularism is one of the two philosophical approaches to the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Problem of the Criterion\|Problem of the Criterion]]. Particularism argues that we can intuitively identify examples of a person having knowledge without having to rely on a criteria for what counts as knowledge. From there, we can use the examples to figure out what the criteria for knowledge should be.

One famous particularist is the American philosopher, Roderick Chisholm.
