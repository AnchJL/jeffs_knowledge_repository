#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Externalism is the position that an agent does not need access to the justification of their beliefs in order to have knowledge. Instead, external factors on their own can justify beliefs so that they become knowledge. Another way of explaining externalism is that an agent can know proposition P without having to know how they know.

## Example: Chicken Sexer

Consider the example of a chicken sexer, someone whose job is to identify whether chickens are male or female. One particular chicken sexer is able to reliably use their sense of smell to determine the sex of a chicken. However, this chicken sexer is unaware that he is relying on his sense of smell and has no good reason to believe in his chicken sexer capabilities. Nonetheless, the chicken sexer is able to form true beliefs that are justified by his chicken sexing abilities, even if he cannot articulate why he knows.

In the above example, the chicken sexer does not have *internal* access to the justification of their belief that a particular chicken is male or female (they do not know why their belief is justified). Instead, the justification for their belief rests in the reliability of their sense of smell, which is *external* to what the chicken sexer knows. While [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Epistemic Internalism\|epistemic internalists]] would claim that the chicken sexer does not actually know the sex of any chicken they identify, externalists would claim that they do know.
