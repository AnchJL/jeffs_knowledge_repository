#Philosophy/Epistemology 

The American philosopher, Edmund Gettier, published an article in 1963 titled, [Is justified True Belief Knowledge?](https://fitelson.org/proseminar/gettier.pdf). In the paper, he challenges the the idea that knowledge is [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Justified True Belief\|Justified True Belief]] by proposing counterexamples known as Gettier cases. These cases demonstrate that someone can have a justified true belief and yet still lack knowledge due to the involvement of luck. A vital assumption Gettier makes is [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Epistemic Closure\|Epistemic Closure]], the idea that if one knows proposition P and knows that P entails proposition Q then they also know Q.  Below are some examples of Gettier cases.

## Example 1

The first Gettier case used in his paper goes as follows. Suppose two candidates, Smith and Jones, applied for the same job. After each of their interviews, Smith is assured by the president of the company that Jones will be hired. Smith also knows that Jones has ten coins in his pocket from counting them (why Smith is counting how many coins are in other people's pockets is questionable but not relevant for this thought experiment). Smith forms the conclusion that the candidate with ten coins in his pocket will get the job offer. Later it turns out that Smith will be the one who gets hired and unbeknownst to him, he also has ten coins in his pocket.

In this example, Smith was justified in believing that Jones would get the job because the president of the company told him so and he was also justified in believing Jones had ten coins in his pocket because he had counted them. Due to epistemic enclosure, Smith was therefore justified in believing the proposition "the candidate with ten coins in his pocket will be hired," and ended up being correct. Therefore, Smith satisfied every JTB criteria. but still did not know that the candidate with ten coins will be hired he. Smith's initial belief that Jones would get the job offer was wrong and he did not know how many coins he had in his own pocket, but his belief in the proposition that "the candidate with ten coins in his pocket will be hired" happened to be correct by chance.
## Example 2

The second example used in Gettier's paper is as follows: suppose that Smith has justification to believe that Jones owns a Ford vehicle and has always had a Ford vehicle for as long as they can remember. We can call Smith's belief that Jones currently owns a Ford proposition (a). Now suppose that Smith has another friend, Brown, whose whereabouts are currently unknown to Smith. The truth of proposition (a) entails the truth of these three propositions below:

Proposition (b): Either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Boston
Proposition (c): Either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona
Proposition (d): Either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Tokyo

Given that Smith is justified in believing in proposition (a), that Jones currently owns a Ford, then he is also justified in believing propositions (b), (c), and (d). However, it just so happens that Jones currently does not own a Ford but is renting one. It also just so happens that Brown is in Barcelona. We cannot say that Smith knew proposition (c) since he did not know (a) because (a) is false. However, Smith believed in (c), was justified in believing (c), and (c) happened to be true. Therefore, this is another example where someone does not have knowledge despite having a justified true belief.

## Example 3

The above examples Gettier used may seem convoluted. Here is a common Gettier case that is possibly more straightforward. Suppose your local subway station had a large clock that is typically accurate and reliable. You approach the subway one day, look at at the clock and see that it says it is 9:00AM. From there, you form the justified belief that it is 9:00AM. However, subway clock broke and its hands stopped at 9:00AM the day before. It just so happens that the time was actually 9:00AM when you looked at the broken clock, resulting in the clock to be right on accident. Due to luck being involved, we would not say that you knew it was 9:00AM even though you had a justified and true belief that was the time.

## Response to the Gettier Problem

Despite it being quite short, Edmund's paper revolutionized the field of epistemology and made philosophers seriously reconsider justified true belief is an adequate definition of knowledge. Epistemologists have come up with several different responses to the problem of Gettier cases. Below are several proposed definitions of knowledge that attempt to address the Gettier problem:
- [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Causal Theory of Knowledge\|Causal Theory of Knowledge]]
- [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Reliabilism\|Reliabilism]]
- [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Tracking Theory of Knowledge\|Tracking Theory of Knowledge]]
- [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge-First Approach\|Knowledge-First Approach]]
