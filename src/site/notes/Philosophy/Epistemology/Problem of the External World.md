The problem of the external world concerns whether we can have [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Perceptual Knowledge\|Perceptual Knowledge]] of the world as it really is. The rationale behind the problem of the external world stems from the fact that our perceptions are fallible and can deceive us. Our inability to distinguish genuine impressions from illusions through perception alone, how can we be sure that the world as we perceive it matches with the world as it actually is? The possibility that our perceptions do not provide an accurate representation of the world leads us to doubt whether we can know anything about the world outside of our perceptions. Thus, the problem of the external world is an argument in favour of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Skepticism\|Skepticism]].
