#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Epistemic internalism is the position that for an agent to have knowledge, they must have access to the justification for a belief. In other words, the agent must know how they know something. To give an example, Jones and Smith believe that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on earth. The difference between the two is that Jones does not remember where or how he learned that fact. In contrast, Smith remembers that he learned that fact from reading a geography textbook back when he was in middle school. According to the internalist perspective, Smith knows that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain whereas Jones merely believes it.

Critics of internalism point out that agents would need to have access to higher order levels of justification in order to have knowledge. That is to say that an agent must know how they know how they know something. To use the previous example, Smith must be able to know why the geography textbook that he read was trustworthy. Whatever he uses to justify the belief that his school textbook was trustworthy must in turn be justified by another belief. The internalist perspective would require an [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Infinitism\|infinite]] chain of justification. Since no one possesses an infinite quantity of beliefs, the internalist perspective collapses into radical skepticism.
