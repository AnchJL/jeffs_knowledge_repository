Proposed by the Prussian philosopher, [[Immanuel Kant\|Immanuel Kant]], transcendental idealism attempts address the challenges with [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Idealism\|Idealism]]. Transcendental idealism is the position that there is a *noumenal world* that gives rise the world we experience through our perceptions, known as the *phenomenal world*. At first glance, transcendental idealism may seem to be another form of indirect realism rather than a form of idealism. However, while indirect realists would say we come to know about the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Problem of the External World\|external world]] indirectly through our sensory experiences, Kant argues that our sensory experiences cannot tell us anything about the external world either directly or indirectly. Rather, we can infer through [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Rationalism\|reason]] that there is an external/noumenal world that is responsible for what we experience in the phenomenal world.
