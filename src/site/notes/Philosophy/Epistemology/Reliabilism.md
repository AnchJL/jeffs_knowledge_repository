#Philosophy/Epistemology
After Alvin Goldman abandoned his [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Causal Theory of Knowledge\|Causal Theory of Knowledge]], he developed a new theory of knowledge known as reliabilism. According to reliabilism, an agent S knows proposition P if:
1. P is true
2. S believes P
3. S's belief in P was attained through a reliable mechanism for producing true beliefs ("reliable" means more likely to successfully produce true beliefs than false beliefs)

Note that S does not need to be consciously aware of why their belief in P is justified in order to know P. This makes reliabilism an [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Epistemic Externalism\|externalist]] theory of knowledge.

To see the appeal of reliabilism, consider the following example: Smith and Jones want to go out for a picnic tomorrow but is unsure of whether it will rain. To determine whether or not it will, Smith flips a coin and deduces that if it lands on heads, then it will rain tomorrow. The coin lands on heads and Smith forms the belief that it will rain tomorrow. Meanwhile, Jones checks the weather forecast for tomorrow and forms the belief that it will rain tomorrow after hearing the weather person say that it will. A day later and it turns out that both Smith and Jones were right. However, we would not say that Smith knew it would rain because he formed this belief in an unreliable manner (a coin flip only gave him a 50/50 chance of being correct). In contrast, Jones formed his belief in a reliable manner since checking the weather forecast would have given him a likely chance of being correct.
## Problems with Reliabilism

### Threshold Problem

A critique of reliabilism is that it does not set a clear threshold for what counts as reliable. Would a mechanism that produces a true belief 99% of the time be correct? Suppose that Lisa bought a ticker in a raffle where you have a 99% change of losing and she formed the belief that she will lose before the raffle even begins. Even though that belief has a 99% chance of being correct, it would seem odd to say that Lisa knows that she will lose. Increasing the probability of losing has no effect on whether we can say that Lisa knows that she will lose; and even if it did, increasing the threshold reduces the number of things we actually know, leading us towards [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Skepticism\|Skepticism]].

### The Generality Problem

The generality problem concerns how broad or narrow of a context should be used in determining whether a belief-forming process is reliable. Consider the following example: Bob is driving with his son through the countryside with barns all around them. Unbeknownst to them, the locals have propped up many fake barns to fool drivers. Bob just so happens to point at the one real barn in the county and says "Look, son! A barn!" Even though Bob satisfies the first two conditions of knowledge under the reliabilist model, he fails to satisfy the third condition. Bob was relying on his vision to infer that he was pointing at a real barn. However, his belief-forming mechanism would have been unreliable since every other barn in the county was fake; the barn he pointed at was more likely to be fake than real. Hence, Bob lacked knowledge in this narrow context, according to reliabilism.

However, Bob's belief-forming process (i.e., his vision) was only unreliable in this narrow context because he was driving through a county where the majority of barns are fake. In a broader context outside the county, Bob's vision would have been a reliable process for forming the belief that he sees a real barn. So should the reliability of Bob's belief-forming process be evaluated in the narrow or broader context?
