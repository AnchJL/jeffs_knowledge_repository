#Philosophy/Epistemology 

One common definition of knowledge is justified true belief, or JTB. Under this definition, it can be said that person S knows proposition P if and only if:
1. S believes P
2. P is true
3. S is justified in believing P
The JTB model of knowledge used to be the standard definition of knowledge, and was hence often referred to as the classical account of knowledge. It is also sometimes referred to as the tripartite model of knowledge due to having three required conditions. To see why it would make sense to view knowledge as JTB, let's break down the requirements of knowing something.
## Belief

Some people consider belief and knowledge to be separate from each other. For example, someone could say "I don't just believe that is the case, I know that is the case" to emphasize their certainty. While belief may not seem to be necessary for knowledge in this case, it would be weird to know a certain proposition but not believe in it. Consider an example where someone knows it is raining outside but believes that it is not raining. Such a scenario seems contradictory because intuitively, what we know has to align with what we believe. Thus, at a minimum, knowledge of x requires a belief in x.
## Truth

Is it possible to know a false proposition? There are circumstances where we all thought we knew something only to later turn out wrong. But in that just means we never really knew what we thought we knew in the first place. It sounds strange to hear that someone knows two is an odd number. When we claim someone knows some proposition x, it is typically attribute that said person is correct on something. In order for a belief to be knowledge, it would have to be a true belief.
## Justification

Why is true belief not sufficient to count as knowledge? Consider an example where an Bob is at a horse race and claims that they know horse #4 will win because he likes the number four. Lo and behold, horse #4 wins. Although Bob had a true belief, we would not say he was justified in believing it because liking a horse's number has no bearing on its likelihood to win. He was simply lucky that his belief turned out to be true. We do not ascribe knowledge to people who accidentally stumble upon a correct belief. To see why, let's use the example of an archer. A skilled archer is one who can *usually* shoot his arrows on target. The keyword here is "usually." A novice archer can sometimes hit their target through luck, but they cannot *usually* accomplish this. Similarly, Bob may have been correct in his belief that horse #4 would win on that one occasion, but he would not usually win because liking a horse's race number does not usually mean that particular horse will win. Knowledge requires forming a belief in a way that usually leads to the truth, and that is why justification is also a necessary component for knowledge.

Although the JTB model was once the popular consensus among philosophers, the introduction of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Gettier Cases\|Gettier Cases]] has posed a serious challenge to the JTB model of knowledge. Gettier cases have shown that a belief can be justified and true but still fail to qualify as knowledge, as seen in the Euler diagram below.
