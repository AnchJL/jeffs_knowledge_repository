Epistemology (sometimes called theory of knowledge) is the philosophical study of knowledge. There are broad categories of knowledge: propositional knowledge and ability knowledge.

Propositional knowledge, sometimes referred to as "know-that," is knowledge of propositions. A proposition is a statement that could be either true or false. Examples of propositions include:
- "An bachelor is an unmarried man"
- "The moon is made of cheese"
- "Two plus two is four"

Ability knowledge, or "know-how," is knowledge on how to perform a certain task. Examples of ability knowledge include:
- Knowing how to swim
- Knowing how to ride a bike
- Knowing how to sing

All animals has some amount of ability knowledge. What is more controversial is whether non-human animals have propositional knowledge. A squirrel knows how to bury a nut, but does it know that "the sky is blue" is a true? This does not seem so clear.

Attempts at what counts as propositional knowledge is a topic of philosophical debate. The former prevailing theory was that knowledge is [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Justified True Belief\|Justified True Belief]], often referred to as the JTB model. However, the introduction of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Gettier Cases\|Gettier Cases]] has cast serious doubt on the JTB model of knowledge.
