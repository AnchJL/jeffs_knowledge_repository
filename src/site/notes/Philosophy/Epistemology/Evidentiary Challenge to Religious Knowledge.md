The evidentiary challenge to religious knowledge states that a lack of supporting evidence for religious beliefs prevents the latter from becoming knowledge, even if they happened to be true. This challenge is based on [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Evidentialism (needs content)\|Evidentialism (needs content)]], which is the position that we can only know things that we have evidence for. Below are several responses to the evidentiary challenge.

## Responses to the Challenge

Proponents of religious knowledge may respond that there is plenty of evidence to support the existence of religious knowledge. They may point to things such as scripture or the testimony of religious officials. However, what the evidentialist wants is *independent* evidence; i.e. evidence that would convince someone who didn't already have religious beliefs. Thus, while appealing to scripture might be convincing evidence to someone who already believes in religious claims, they would not be convincing evidence to someone who is irreligious.

This leaves proponents of religious knowledge with three possible responses to the challenge:
1. Provide independent evidence of religious knowledge (see [[Philosophy/Philosophy of Religion/Natural Theology\|Natural Theology]])
2. Abandon this challenge (see [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Fideism\|Fideism]])
3. Lower the standards required from this challenge (see [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Reformed Epistemology\|Reformed Epistemology]])
