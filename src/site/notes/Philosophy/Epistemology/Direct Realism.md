Direct realism is the position that, in cases where we are not being deceived, we directly perceive the world as it is through our senses. Direct realists can accept that we do not directly perceive the world as it is but only as it appears in cases where we are being deceived, such as when we see a mirage of an oasis. However, they do not accept that this also applies to cases where we are being deceived. The fact that we do not see the world as it is when we are being deceived has no bearing on whether we directly perceive the world in non-deceived cases.
