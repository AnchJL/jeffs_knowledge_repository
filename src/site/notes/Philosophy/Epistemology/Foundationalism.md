#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Foundationalism is one of the three major approaches to the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Münchhausen Trilemma\|Münchhausen Trilemma]].  According to foundationalism, our beliefs are justified by a set of foundational beliefs. These foundational beliefs are not justified by any further beliefs, but rather they are self-justifying. One example of a foundational belief is the [[I Think, Therefore I am\|belief in one's own existence]], as argued forth by Rene Descartes.

A challenge for foundationalists is deciding how broad or narrow our set of foundational beliefs should be. If we restrict our foundational beliefs to just beliefs that are infallible (impossible to be wrong), then we would be unable to justify many of our current beliefs. Examples of infallible beliefs include the belief that I exist or the belief that 1+1=2. However, neither of those beliefs seem to justify many of our non-foundational beliefs, such as the fact that Paris is the capital of France or the fact that I have two hands.

A possible response to this problem is the expand our criteria for foundational beliefs to include fallible beliefs as well. A common example of a fallible foundational belief is the belief that our senses are reliable. However, fallible beliefs have the potential to be wrong and therefore provide a weaker foundation for holding up many of our other beliefs.
