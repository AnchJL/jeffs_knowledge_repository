#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Skepticism is the position that we know less than we think we do. The most extreme form of this position argues that knowledge is impossible and that we cannot claim to know anything. This extreme form of skepticism is known as **global** or **radical skepticism**.
## Academic and Pyrrhonean Skeptics

Skepticism dates as far back as Ancient Greece. During those times, there were to major schools of skepticism: **Academic skepticism** and **Pyrrhonean skepticism**. Academic skeptics claimed that knowledge is impossible. However, this position seems self-defeating since knowing that "knowledge is impossible" requires knowledge to be possible, which is a direct contradiction. In contrast, the Pyrrhonean skeptics went one step further and avoided making any positive claims. Instead, they would suspend judgement on all claims, including the claim that knowledge is impossible.
## Skeptical Hypothesis

Radical skepticism is motivated by the possibility of various **skeptical hypotheses**, which are possible scenarios where we are massively deceived about our reality even though we experience the world as though we were not deceived. Below are some commonly cited skeptical hypothesis:
- You are stuck in a dream without realizing it
- You are a brain in a vat, connected to a supercomputer that provides your brain with false experiences that feel real
- You are stuck in a simulated reality like Neo from the Matrix
- An evil demon is putting false beliefs into your head that you accept as true
What is common among all these scenarios is that we have no way of knowing that we are not in one of those situations. 

Using the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Epistemic Closure\|Epistemic Closure]] principle, we can make the following argument using [[modus tollens\|modus tollens]]:
- Premise 1: If you know some fact about the world, X, then you know you are not being deceived about X
- Premise 2: You do not know you are not being deceived
- Conclusion: You do not know X
If any one of the skeptical hypotheses are true, then everything we thought we knew about our world would be false, and thus would not actually be knowledge.

## Responses to Skepticism

There have been multiple kinds of responses to the challenge of radical skepticism. These responses include, but are not limited to:
- Hilary Putnam's Semantic Externalism Response to Skepticism
- Renee Descartes' Response
- Moorean Shift
- [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Contextualism\|Contextualism]]
- Pragmatism
- Arguments that [[Skepticism is Self-Defeating\|Skepticism is Self-Defeating]]
- [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Contextualism\|Contextualism]]
