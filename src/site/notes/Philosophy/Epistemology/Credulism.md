#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Credulism is one of the the solutions to the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Testimony#The Problem with Testimony\|the problem of testimony]]. According to credulism, we are justified in believing in testimony even when we do not have epistemic grounds to do so. This is generally taken to be the common sense view, since most of us assume by default that we can believe in other people's testimony unless they have provided us with a reason to distrust them.
