#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Coherentism is one of the three major philosophical positions on the structure of justification. Coherentism is the position that our beliefs all support each other in a circular manner. Although any small set of beliefs can justify each other, coherentists typically stipulate the the web of beliefs must be sufficiently large.

## Problems with Coherentism

A problem with coherentism is that a large consistent web of beliefs can still fail to be true. For example, the belief that the sun orbited the earth would have been consistent with their belief that the sun rises and sets on the horizon. However, we would not consider the medieval person to have knowledge because we now know that the earth orbits the sun instead and that the rising and setting of the sun is actually due to the earth rotating on its axis. 

A famous coherentism is the 20th century American philosopher, W.V.O. Quine.
