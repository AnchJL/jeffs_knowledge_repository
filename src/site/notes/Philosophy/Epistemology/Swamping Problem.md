#Philosophy/Epistemology 

At first glance, it may seem that the instrumental value of knowledge can be attained from *mere* true belief. If a true belief can help you fulfill your goals then it would seem that it is just as valuable as knowledge.

For example, suppose that I had the goal of finding the closest French restaurant to my home. In one scenario, scenario A, I could have a reliable GPS that told me where the closest French restaurant was. In such a scenario, I would have knowledge of where the closest French restaurant is. Alternatively, in scenario B, I could have an outdated and unreliable map that gave me the correct location of the nearest French restaurant by coincidence. This would give me a true belief but not knowledge since I obtained that belief through luck. In both instances, it would seem that the instrumental value is the same since both the reliable GPS and the unreliable map led me to the desired location.

However, knowledge can have greater instrumental value than mere true belief since knowledge is more *stable*. In scenario B, if I were to discover that the locations of other stores and historical landmarks did not match what I saw on the map, I would conclude the map is unreliable and abandon my true belief in the correct location of the French restaurant. In contrast, this is much less likely to happen with the GPS in scenario A given the GPS is highly reliable. True beliefs are less stable and more likely to be abandoned once conflicting information is encountered, whereas knowledge is more resilient to conflicting information.
