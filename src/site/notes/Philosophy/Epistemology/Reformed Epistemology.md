Reformed epistemology, as a response to the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Evidentiary Challenge to Religious Knowledge\|Evidentiary Challenge to Religious Knowledge]], can be seen as the middle position between fideism and [[Philosophy/Philosophy of Religion/Natural Theology\|Natural Theology]]. According to reformed epistemology, religious knowledge/beliefs are *properly basic*, meaning they do not require further justification.

Reformed epistemologists, such as [[Alvin Plantinga\|Alvin Plantinga]], argue that evidentialists hold religious beliefs to a higher epistemic standard than most of our other beliefs. For example, many of our perceptual beliefs are taken to be true at face value. Suppose that a skeptic walked up to you and asked you for *independent* evidence in support of our perceptual beliefs; independent here meaning that the evidence should be able to convince someone who does not already have any perceptual beliefs. It would seem to be impossible to provide evidence in favour of our perceptual beliefs without relying on our perceptual beliefs. Nonetheless, we trust our perceptions and would consider our perceptual knowledge to be properly basic.

Religious knowledge would be analogous to the above example, where we cannot provide independent evidence to support it, but we would not necessarily be unjustified in believing it.
