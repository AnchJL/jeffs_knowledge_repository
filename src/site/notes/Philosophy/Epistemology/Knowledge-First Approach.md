#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Traditionally, it was thought that certain beliefs form the building blocks of knowledge This position is known as the *belief-first* approach to epistemology. As an analogy, water is not primary since it is composed of two hydrogen and one oxygen atoms, which can be further broken down into subatomic particles. Furthermore, there are more oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the universe than there are water molecules. The difficulty in finding an adequate definition of knowledge after the introduction of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Gettier Cases\|Gettier Cases]] has led some to question whether knowledge refers to true belief + some additional condition. This led to Timothy Williamson to develop the *knowledge-first* approach to epistemology, which views knowledge as more primary than belief.
