#Philosophy/Epistemology

A Priori and A Posteriori refer to two different types of knowledge based on how they were obtained or justified.

**A Priori knowledge** is knowledge that can be derived solely through [[Philosophy/Logic/Deductive Reasoning\|Deductive Reasoning]]. Examples of a priori knowledge include:
- 1+1=2
- If Socrates is a man and all men are mortal, then Socrates is mortal
- A bachelor is an unmarried man
- "[[I Think, Therefore I am\|I Think, Therefore I am]]"

**A Posteriori knowledge** is knowledge that is derived from **sensory experiences**. Examples of a posteriori knowledge include:
- Paris is the capital of France
- Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on earth
- I have two hands
- This apple is red

 A common way of understanding this difference is that a priori knowledge can be obtained while sitting in an armchair and just thinking, while a posteriori knowledge requires getting out of my armchair.

A priori and a posteriori are not wholly separate from each other. Some examples of knowledge requires the use of reason and empirical investigation. For example, a detective observes that the suspect's fingerprints were the only finger prints found on a murder weapon. The detective then reasons that the suspect committed the crime based on this empirical fact.

Some examples of a priori knowledge can be obtained through empirical investigation. For example, the belief that all bachelors are unmarried men can be derived by observing that every bachelor one has come across is in fact an unmarried man. In contrast, a posteriori knowledge cannot be derived through reason alone. One cannot come to know that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain just by thinking really hard. They would have to either measure Mount Everest directly themselves or look up that fact from a source.
