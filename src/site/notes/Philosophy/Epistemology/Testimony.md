#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Testimony refers to information that is intentionally transmitted from one person to another through verbal speech, books, pictures, videos, or any other medium. Most of our beliefs about the world comes from the testimony of other people.
## The Problem with Testimony

An issue with testimony is whether it can be relied upon for gaining knowledge. For example, Bob only knows that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world because his dad told him so. Since Bob never personally measured the height of Mount Everest himself, he does not know if his dad was lying to him or was mistaken about the tallest mountain in the world. Bob could try to verify his dad's claim by asking another individual or by searching it up on the internet. However, he would be relying on the testimony of other people to verify the testimony of his dad. How do we know we can rely on testimony to obtain knowledge in the first place? We cannot justify our reliance on testimony by relying on further testimony. However, if we accept that we cannot obtain knowledge through testimony then that means most of our beliefs about the world are not knowledge, leading us towards [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Skepticism\|radical skepticism]].

The unreliability of testimony has led [[John Locke\|John Locke]] to argue that we can approximate but never derive knowledge from testimony.
