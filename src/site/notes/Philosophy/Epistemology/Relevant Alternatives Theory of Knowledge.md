#Philosophy/Epistemology 

 The relevant alternatives theory of knowledge is an account of knowledge that first emerged during the early 1970s. According to the theory, a person knows proposition P if they can rule out all the relevant alternatives that would make P false. 
 
 Consider a situation in which Bob sees a moose in the distance. Assuming that nothing is wrong with Bobâ€™s vision, we would normally treat his belief that there is a moose in the distance as knowledge. However, it could be the case that the creature he sees is not a moose but two men in a realistic moose costume. Since a creature cannot simultaneously be a moose and not a moose (see [[Philosophy/Logic/Law of Non-Contradiction\|Law of Non-Contradiction]]), then according to the principle of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Epistemic Closure\|Epistemic Closure]], if Bob knows that the creature is a moose then he also knows that it is not two men in a costume. However, skeptics would argue that Bob cannot rule out the relevant alternative that the distant moose is just a costume, and so he does not know that the moose in front of him is fake. It would seem that the relevant alternatives theory of knowledge violates the principle of epistemic closure.

Gail Stine published a paper in 1976, in which they proposed the concept of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Contextualism\|Contextualism]] to reconcile the appeal of ruling out relevant alternatives with epistemic closure.
