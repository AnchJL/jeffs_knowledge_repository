#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Virtue epistemology is the position that knowledge is true beliefs gained through an agent's reliable use of their epistemic virtues or cognitive faculties. This position is the epistemological analogue of [[Virtue Ethics\|Virtue Ethics]].

Epistemic virtues refer to learned or acquired character traits that make someone more capable of arriving at true beliefs. Examples of an epistemic virtue would include conscientiousness, being observant, and intellectual humility (being receptive to other viewpoints and acknowledging that you can be wrong). Cognitive faculties refer to innate traits, such as vision or memory. In contrast to our cognitive faculties, we are not born with perfect epistemic virtues. Rather, we have to cultivate our epistemic virtues over time through practice.

According to virtue epistemologists, it is not enough for an agent to merely have a reliable mechanism of arriving at a true belief in order to have knowledge. The agent must have a trait that allows them to reliable come to a true belief in order for said belief to count as knowledge. 

Consider the following example: Bob is at home and looks at an otherwise reliable digital thermometer to infer the temperature of the room he is in. Unbeknownst to Bob, someone is playing a prank on him. The prankster broke the thermostat so that it fluctuates and no longer accurately displays the temperature of Bob's home. The prankster uses a specialized machine to change the temperature of Bob's home so that it always measures the reading displayed on his thermostat. According to [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Reliabilism\|Reliabilism]], Bob has a reliable method of forming a belief on the temperature of his home (looking at his thermometer) and therefore has knowledge. However, it remains questionable as to whether Bob knows the temperature of his home. In contrast, virtue epistemologists would say that Bob does not know because his true belief on what is the temperature of his home is not the result of him relying on his epistemic virtues or cognitive faculties but the result an external factor: the prankster controlling the temperature of his home.

A related are of study is vice epistemology, which studies epistemic vices. Examples of epistemic vices include, but are not limited to:
- Dogmatism
- Close-mindedness
- Hubris
- Intellectual Laziness
- Incuriosity
