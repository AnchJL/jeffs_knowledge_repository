#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Justification is often taken to be a *necessary*, although *not sufficient*, condition for knowledge. A central question in epistemology is how beliefs are justified. A belief can be justified by another belief; but what in turn justifies that supporting belief? Perhaps another belief can justify the supporting belief; but what justifies the belief that supports the supporting belief? 

To use an example, Bob believes that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on earth. Ann asks Bob what justified his belief that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain, to which Bob replies that he remembered learning that fact from a school textbook. But Ann then asks what justifies Bob's belief that what the textbook told him is true? Bob then replies that his geography teacher confirmed that the school textbook was accurate. But what justifies his belief that his geography teacher is trustworthy? The MÃ¼nchhausen trilemma refers to the three unsatisfactory resolutions to this chain of justification, which are:

1. Our beliefs are justified by an infinite regress of supporting beliefs. This position is known as [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Infinitism\|Infinitism]]
2. Our beliefs are justified by a circular chains of supporting beliefs. This position is known as [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Coherentism\|Coherentism]].
3. Our beliefs are justified by a set of supporting beliefs that cannot be further justified. This position is known as [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Foundationalism\|Foundationalism]]
