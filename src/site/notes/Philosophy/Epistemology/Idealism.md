Idealism is the position that there is no external world that is separate from our senses. To put it another way, there is no world as it actually but only the world as we perceive it. Under this view, [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Indirect Realism#Distinction Between Primary and Secondary Qualities\|secondary but not primary qualities exist]].

According to idealists, the world is dependent and constructed by our perceptions. This concept is captured by the following quote by the empiricist philosopher, George Berkeley: 

> To be is to be perceived
> -George Berkely

A problem with this view is that it implies that objects and events do not exist if there is no agent to perceive it. For example, a tree cannot fall in the forest if there is no one there to see or hear it fall. If much of the world does not exist because there is no one to perceive it, then it would seem that idealism lends credence to [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Skepticism\|skepticism]] about perceptual knowledge.

Berkeley attempted to address this peculiarity by arguing that God is an omnipresent observer who can perceive everything. This would allow things to still exist outside of *human* perception. However, this argument would not work for those who do not believe in God.
