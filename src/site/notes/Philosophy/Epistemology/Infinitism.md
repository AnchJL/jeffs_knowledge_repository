#Philosophy/Epistemology 

Infinitism is one of the three major positions on the structure of justification in epistemology. According to infinitism, our beliefs are justified by an infinite chain of beliefs. Compared to the other positions on the structure of justification, this position is the least popular response to the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Münchhausen Trilemma\|Münchhausen Trilemma]].
