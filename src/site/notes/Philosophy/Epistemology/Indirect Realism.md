Indirect realism is the position that our senses provide us with indirect knowledge of the world around us. That is to say that we can only infer how the world actually is from perceiving the world in how it appears.
## Arguments for Indirect Realism

### Argument from Illusion

For example, when a straw enters a glass of water at an angle, the straw *appears* to bend in the water despite it remaining straight. Similarly, a mirage can make it seems like there is an desert oasis on the horizon where there is none. Upon closer inspection, we realize in both situations that there is a mismatch between what we see and what is actually happening. Our knowledge of how refraction works explains why the straw *appears* to bend when placed in a glass of water and why there *appears* to be an oasis in front of us in deserts.

Suppose that Bob sees an actual oasis up ahead while Smith sees a mirage that looks like an oasis. Both individuals receive the same sensory input that results in them having identical perceptions. The only difference is that Bob's perception is caused by a real oasis and Smith's perception is caused by an illusion. The fact that two identical perceptions can have different causes suggests that we do not directly perceive the world as it really is but we perceive it indirectly through a *veil of perception*.
### Distinction Between Primary and Secondary Qualities

English empiricist philosopher, John Locke, introduced the distinction between primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are the properties of an object that are not dependent on the observer. Examples of primary qualities include shape, volume, and mass.

Secondary qualities are the properties of an object that *are* dependent on the observer. An example of a secondary quality would be colour. There are animals who can see beyond the range of colours visible to humans. People who are colour blind are unable to distinguish certain colours because they perceive them differently from non-colour blind people. This is not to say that there is no objective fact of the matter on the frequency of the light radiation being reflected off of objects. This is only to say that how an object's colour is perceived is dependent on the perceiver.

This distinction between primary and secondary qualities is explained well by indirect realism. Primary qualities exist in the world as it actually is while secondary qualities exist in the world as it appears to us.
## Arguments against Indirect Realism

### [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Problem of the External World\|Problem of the External World]]

One problem with indirect realism is that if all we can perceive is our impressions of the world, then we cannot be certain if our beliefs about the world outside of our impressions are true. There are numerous [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Skepticism\|skeptical scenarios]] in which we could be deceived about our beliefs about the external world. Some examples could include an evil demon could be feeding you with false sensory inputs or you could be a brain in a vat that is experiencing a simulated reality. Altogether, indirect realism inevitably leads to [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Skepticism\|Skepticism]].
### No Distinction between Primary and Secondary Qualities

One argument against indirect realism is to counter the distinction between primary and secondary qualities.
