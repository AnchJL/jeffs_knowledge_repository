## Traditional Account of Ignorance as Lack of Knowledge

There are a few ways to define ignorance. The common and traditional view of ignorance is that it is a lack of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge\|Knowledge]]. This is the simplest view of ignorance and it matches how we use the term to describe people who do not know something. 

An issue with this traditional view of ignorance arises when you consider it in light of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Gettier Cases\|Gettier Cases]]. For example, consider the example of Bob looking at a broken clock that is stuck at 9:00AM, which just so happens to be the correct time. Bob has a justified true belief but lacks knowledge since his belief just happened to be correct by luck. However, it is not clear whether Bob is ignorant of the time even though he lacks knowledge.

The hesitancy in calling people in Gettier cases ignorant is because ignorance reflects a failure in intellectual character and not just lacking knowledge on a particular proposition. We can think of ignorance in two different ways: as **propositional ignorance** and as **character ignorance**. Propositional ignorance describes someone who is ignorant about certain propositions. Meanwhile, character ignorance describes someone who has certain character failings that make them prone to being propositionally ignorant. Given this distinction, someone can be ignorant about a particular proposition without being character ignorant. Likewise, a person can be character ignorant but still know certain propositions.

This distinction helps to explain why we are hesitant in ascribing ignorance to people in Gettier cases. In the above example, Bob did not actually know the time but he was not character ignorant because he did not show any failures in intellectual character; he formed the belief in a reasonable manner given the circumstances. The issue, however, is that Gettier cases separate propositional ignorance from character ignorance despite their close association with each other.

## Ignorance as Lack of True Belief

An alternative ignorance as lack of knowledge is that the view that ignorance is a lack of true belief. Under this account of ignorance, a person who has an unjustified but true belief would still count as having knowledge. Consider the example where Bob correctly guesses a question on an online quiz. Although we would not say that Bob knew the answer, it would be odd to describe him as being ignorant if he genuinely has a true belief.

The issue with ignorance as a lack of true belief is that it makes it too easy to avoid the charge of being ignorant. A person can arrive at a true belief through an epistemically unreliable or inappropriate manner, and yet not qualify as ignorant. In contrast, under the ignorance as lack knowledge account, a person who arrives at a false belief through an otherwise reliable method would count as ignorant. Defining ignorance as lack of true belief is too permissive while defining it as lack of knowledge is too strict.
## Ignorance as a Normative Standing

A third account of ignorance is the normative account. The normative account of knowledge states that ignorance involves a lack of knowledge due to an individual's *intellectual failing*.

This account of knowledge helps us to come over the problem posed by Gettier cases. Although the people involved Gettier cases may lack knowledge, they cannot be called ignorant because they formed their belief in an epistemically appropriate manner.

Another advantage of the normative account of ignorance is that it bridges the gap between character ignorance and propositional ignorance. A person displays character ignorance if they are ignorant of a proposition due to an intellectual failing they have.

What counts as an intellectual failing depends on the social context, but an intellectual failing is when a person fails to know something when they are in a position to know. For example, we do not accuse children of having an ignorant character for not knowing things that we expect adults to know. 

Here is another example: suppose Bob's friend John is a physician. Both of them do not know anything about the recent developments the medical field that pertain to John's work. There is no expectation for Bob to know about any of this because he is a layman. Therefore, it would be wrong to accuse him of having an intellectual failing since he is not in a position to know any of the recent developments in medicine. In contrast, John is expected to be up-to-date on these medical developments if they are within his field of expertise. Unlike Bob, John can be said to have an intellectual failing since he is in a position to know about these recent developments but fails to know about them.
