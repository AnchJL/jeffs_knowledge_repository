#Math/Statistics 

In statistics, a variable is a characteristic of a population that we are interested in studying. Examples of variables can be age, income, test scores, GDP, gender, etc. In statistics, we are typically interested in the [[Math/Statistics/Mean, Median, and Mode\|average]] and distribution of a variable and its relationship with other variables.

There are many different types of variables. The image below shows the hierarchy of different types of variables in statistics.

## Numerical Variables

Numerical (or quantitative) variables are variables that can be assigned a numerical value.

### Discrete Variables

Discrete variables can only be whole numbers. For these types of variables, it would not make sense to have a decimal value.

Examples of discrete variables include:
- Calendar Years
- Number of people
- Roll of a die
### Continuous Variables

Continuous variables can take on any real number, including decimals.

Examples of continuous variables include:
- Income
- Height
- Weight

## Categorical Variable

Categorical (or qualitative) variables cannot be assigned a numerical value. Instead, they can be assigned groups or categories.

### Ordinal Variables

Ordinal variables represent groups that have a natural order to them.

Examples of ordinal variables:
- Education level (high school, bachelors, masters, doctorate, post-doctorate)
- Socioeconomic class (working class, middle class, upper class)

### Nominal Variables

Nominal variables represent groups that do not have a natural order.

Examples of nominal variables include:
- Gender
- Political ideology
- City
