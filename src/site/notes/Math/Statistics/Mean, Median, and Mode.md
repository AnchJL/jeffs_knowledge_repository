#Math/Statistics

The mean, median, and mode refer to three different ways of calculating the central measure or value of a [[sample\|sample]] of data points.
## Mean

The mean, often referred to as the average, is calculated by taking the sum of all values in a sample and then dividing it by the sample size. In other words, given $n$ number of data points, the average $\bar{x}$ of the sample is:
$$
\bar{x}=\sum_i^n\frac{x_i}{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i^nx_i
$$
Example: find the mean of the following sample $\{24,36,17,23\}$

1. The sum of the values in the sample is: 
$$
24+36+17+23=100
$$
2. The total number of values (i.e. the sample size) is 4
3. Therefore, the mean is:
$$
\bar{x}=\frac{100}{4}=25
$$
## Median

The median can be found by arranging the values from the least to greatest, and then selecting the middle-most value.

Example: find the median of the following sample: 
$$
\{11,2,5,7,3\}
$$
1. Rearrange the values in ascending order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
2. The median is the value in the middle, which is 5

In the case where there is an even number of values, you can find the median by taking the sum of the two middle-most values and then divide by 2.

Example: find the median of the following sample
$$
\{2,4,6,8,10,12\}
$$
1. Take the sum of the middle-most values, which are 6 and 8:
$$
6+8=14
$$
2. Divide the sum of the two middle values by 2 to find the median:
$$
\text{Median: }\frac{14}{2}=7
$$
## Mode

The mode can be obtained by finding the value with the most frequent occurrence.

For example, find the mode of the following sample:
$$
\{12,23,19,25,19,12,19\}
$$
The value 19 appears three times in the sample, more than any other value. Therefore, 19 is the mode of the sample above.
