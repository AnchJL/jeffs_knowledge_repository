#Math/Statistics 

**Descriptive statistics** is the practice of merely describing the data obtained from a *sample*, which is a collection of data points taken from a broader population that we are trying to study.

**Inferential statistics** is the practice of taking the data you collected from a sample to make inferences about the *population* it is supposed to represent.

To use an example, say we want to study the proportion of left-handedness among the population of the United States. 
- However, we are unable to directly study the entire population given its massive size. 
- Instead, we take a representative sample from the broader population and use descriptive statistics to study the sample. After some statistical analysis, we find that 10% of the people in the sample are left-handed. 
	- Measurements relating to the sample are known as the *sample statistic*.
- We can use inferential statistics to make inferences about the population using what we know from the sample. In this case, we can infer that about 10% of the American population is left-handed, given that 10% of people in the sample are left-handed. This 10% figure for the population is known as the *population parameter*.
	- Measurements relating to the population are known as the *population parameter*.

[[Math/Probability Theory/What is Probability\|Probability]] is what connects descriptive statistics to inferential statistics, and allow us to make inferences about a population from a sample.
