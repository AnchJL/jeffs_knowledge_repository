#Math/Statistics 

To find the z-score of a particular data point:
$$
z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
$$
Another way to interpret the z-score is that it measures the number of [[Math/Statistics/Variance and Standard Deviation\|standard deviations]] a particular data point is above or below the sample mean. For example, a z-score of -2 means that a particular value has a distance of two standard deviations below the sample mean.

A z-score is important in [[hypothesis testing\|hypothesis testing]] determining [[Confidence Interval\|confidence intervals]].

## Z-Score Probabilities Table
Below is a table displaying the area or probability of being on the *right-side* of a standardized [[Math/Statistics/Normal Distribution\|normal distribution]] based on the z-score:
