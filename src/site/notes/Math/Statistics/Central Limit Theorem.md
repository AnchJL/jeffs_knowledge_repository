#Math/Statistics 

According to the Central Limit Theorem, a sampling distribution with a sufficiently large sample size will approach a [[Math/Statistics/Normal Distribution\|normal distribution]], regardless of the distribution of the original population. The central limit theorem also tells us that the mean of the sampling distribution will approximate the population mean, given a sufficiently large enough sample.

## Example:

Suppose you
