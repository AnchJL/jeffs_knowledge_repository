#Math/Algebra 

A system of linear equations is any set of linear equations that use the same variable. For example:
1. $-4x+3y=-2$
2. $6x+3y=6$
Equations 1 and 2 together is an example of a system of linear equations.

Methods of solving linear equations include:
- Substitution
- Elimination
- Graphing the equations

## Substitution

> [!Example] Use the substitution method to solve the following system of linear equations: $$\begin{align}\\&1.-4x+3y=-2\\&2.\ 6x+3y=6\end{align}$$
> Solve for y in equation 1
> $$3y=-2+4x$$
> $$y=-\frac{2}{3}+\frac{4}{3}x$$
> Substitute $y=\frac{4}{3}x-\frac{2}{3}$ into equation 2
> $$6x+3(\frac{4}{3}x-\frac{2}{3})=6$$
> $$6x+4x-2=6$$
> $$10x=8$$
> $$x=\frac{8}{10}=\frac{4}{5}$$
> Substitute $x=\frac{4}{5}$ into equation 1 (substituting into equation 2 works as well)
> $$-4(\frac{4}{5}+3y)=-2$$
> $$-\frac{16}{5}+3y=-2$$
> $$3y=-2+\frac{16}{5}=\frac{-10+16}{5}=\frac{6}{5}$$
> $$y=\frac{6}{5\cdot3}=\frac{6}{15}=\frac{2}{5}$$
> $$\therefore x=\frac{4}{5},\ y=\frac{2}{5}$$
