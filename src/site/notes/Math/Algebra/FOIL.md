#Math/Algebra 

FOIL describes the way in which to multiply binomials. FOIL stands First, Outer, Inner, and Last.

1. Multiply the first terms in each binomial
2. Multiply the outer terms
3. Multiply the inner terms
4. Multiply the last terms
5. Add all the above together

After implementing FOIL, you get the following result:
$$
(a+b)(c+d)=ac+ad+bc+bd
$$
