#Math/Algebra 

Linear equations are first degree polynomials (meaning the highest power of any term is 1). Linear equations can be in either y-intercept form or standard form.

**y-intercept Form**: 
$y=mx+b, \text{where x and y are variables, and m and b are constants}$

$m$ is the slope of the graph where $b$ is its slope intercept.

**Standard Form**: $Ax+By=C, \text{where x and y are variables, A and B are coefficients, and C is a constant}$

To convert from standard form to y-intercept form, you need to isolate for the variable $y$:
$$
\begin{align}
By&=C-Ax\\
\\
y&=\frac{C}{B}-\frac{A}{B}x
\end{align}
$$
Once converted to y-intercept form, $\frac{C}{B}$ is the y-intercept and $-\frac{A}{B}$ is the slope.

Linear equations are called such because they form straight lines when graphed. The image below shows the graph of $y=\frac{3}{2}x+2$.

## Finding the x-intercepts

### y-intercept Form

Set $y=0$ and solve for $x$ to find the x-intercept of the linear equation:

$$
\begin{align}
0&=mx+b\\
\\
mx&=-b\\
\\
x&=\frac{-b}{m}
\end{align}
$$
### Standard Form

Set $y=0$ and solve for $x$ to find the x-intercept of the linear equation:

$$
\begin{align}
Ax+B\cdot 0 = C\\
\\
Ax=C\\
\\
x=\frac{C}{A}
\end{align}
$$
