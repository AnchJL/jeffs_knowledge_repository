#Math/Algebra 

Linear equations are first degree polynomials (meaning the highest power of any term is 1). Linear equations can be in either y-intercept form or standard form.

## y-intercept Form 

The y-intercept form of a linear equation is $y=mx+b, \text{where x and y are variables, and m and b are constants}$

$m$ is the slope of the graph where $b$ is its slope intercept.

> [!NOTE] Slope of a line
> The slope of a line is a measure of how steep it is, and can be expressed as a ratio between the change along the y-direction and the change along x-direction as you travel along the line. In other words:
> $$\text{Slope: }m=\frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$
> To find the slope of a particular line, pick any two arbitrary points on it with the coordinates $\{x_1,y_1\}$ and $\{x_2,y_2\}$. The difference in their y-coordinates is their rise (or $\Delta$y) and the difference between their x-coordinates is their run (or $\Delta$x). In other words:
> $$m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$

## Standard Form: 

Standard form of a linear equation is: $Ax+By=C, \text{where x and y are variables, A and B are coefficients, and C is a constant}$

To convert from standard form to y-intercept form, you need to isolate for the variable $y$:
$$
\begin{align}
By&=C-Ax\\
\\
y&=\frac{C}{B}-\frac{A}{B}x
\end{align}
$$
Once converted to y-intercept form, $\frac{C}{B}$ is the y-intercept and $-\frac{A}{B}$ is the slope.

Linear equations are called such because they form straight lines when graphed. The image below shows the graph of $y=\frac{3}{2}x+2$.

## Finding the x-intercepts

### y-intercept Form

Set $y=0$ and solve for $x$ to find the x-intercept of the linear equation:

$$
\begin{align}
0&=mx+b\\
\\
mx&=-b\\
\\
x&=\frac{-b}{m}
\end{align}
$$
### Standard Form

Set $y=0$ and solve for $x$ to find the x-intercept of the linear equation:

$$
\begin{align}
Ax+B\cdot 0 = C\\
\\
Ax=C\\
\\
x=\frac{C}{A}
\end{align}
$$
