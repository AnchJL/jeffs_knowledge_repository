Completing the square is a method for converting quadratic polynomials from standard form $x^2+bx+c$ to vertex form $a(x-h)^2+k$.

## Steps to Completing the Square

$$\begin{align}
&x^2+bx+(\frac{b}{2})^2-(\frac{b}{2})^2+c &\text{Add and subtract ($\frac{b}{2}$})^2\\
\\
&(x^2+bx+(\frac{b}{2})^2)-(\frac{b}{2})^2+c &\text{Place brackets around first three terms}\\
\\
&(x+\frac{b}{2})^2-\frac{b^2}{4}+c &\text{Factor $x^2+bx+(\frac{b}{2})^2$ as it is a perfect square trinomial}
\end{align} 
$$

As can be seen above, $h=-\frac{b}{2}$ and $k=c-\frac{b^2}{4}$
