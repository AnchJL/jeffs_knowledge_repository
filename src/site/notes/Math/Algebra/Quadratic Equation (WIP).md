#Math/Algebra 

Quadratic equations are second degree polynomials, which is to say that the highest power of any term is $2$. Quadratic equations can be expressed in either *vertex form*, *standard form*, or *factored form*. When graphed, quadratic equations form the shape of a parabola. The image below shows the graph of a parabola.

(image to be inserted)
## Vertex Form

$y=a(x-h)^2+k$

This form is called the vertex form because $(h,k)$ form the coordinates of the highest or lowest point of the graph.
## Standard Form

$y=ax^2+bx+c$

## Factored Form

$y=a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)$

$r_1$ and $r_2$ represent the x-intercepts (aka roots, solutions, or zeros) of the equation. Note that it is not always possible to express a quadratic equation in factored form since not every parabola has x-intercepts.
