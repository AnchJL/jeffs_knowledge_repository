#Math/Probability 

The multiplication rule for probability states that when both $A$ and $B$ are [[independent events\|independent events]], then the probability of both events happening at the same time is the product of the probability of $A$ and the probability of $B$. In other words:

If $A$ and $B$ are independent of each other:
$$
\begin{align}
P(A\text{ and }B)=P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)
\end{align}
$$
For example, two coin tosses are each independent events because the first coin toss does not affect the probabilities of the second coin toss, and vice versa. The odds of getting heads twice in a row is:
$$
P(H)
$$In contrast, if $A$ and $B$ are not necessarily independent from each other:
$$
P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B|A)=P(B)\cdot P(A|B)
$$
