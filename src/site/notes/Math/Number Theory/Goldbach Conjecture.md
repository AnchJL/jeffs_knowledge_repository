#Math/NumberTheory 

Goldbach's conjecture is an unsolved problem that states that every even number greater than 4 is the sum of two primes. Although this appears to be the case and no counterexample has been found, Goldbach's conjecture remains to be proven.

Example even numbers that are the sum of two primes:
$6=3+3$
$12=5+7$
$32=19+13$
