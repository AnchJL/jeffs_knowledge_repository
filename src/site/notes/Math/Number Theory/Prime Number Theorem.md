#Math/NumberTheory 

Consider the function $\pi(x)$ equal to the number of primes between $1$ and $x$. Towards the end of the 19th century, it was found through experiments by J Hadamard and de la Vallee Poussin that for very large values of $x$, $$\pi(x)\approx\frac{x}{\ln{x}}$$To put it another way,
$$
\lim_{x\to \infty}\frac{\pi(x)}{x/\ln(x)}=1
$$
The prime number theorem is useful for deriving the number of primes below a certain value of $x$.
