#Math/NumberTheory 
Fermat's last theorem used to be one of the most famous unsolved problems in math.

$$
\begin{align}
a^n+b^n=c^n
\end{align}
$$
Where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $n$ are positive integers. Fermat's last theorem states that there is no solution to the above equation for when $n\geq2$.

Fermat claimed to have had proof for this theorem but did not have enough space to write it out. It was not until 1995 that the proof for the theorem was published by Andrew Wiles.
