#Math/NumberTheory 

A *twin prime* refers to any pair of prime numbers that have a difference of 2. Below are some examples of twin primes:
- 3 and 5 are twin primes, as are
- 5 and 7
- 11 and 13
- 17 and 19

The twin prime conjecture is an unsolved problem that asks whether there are an infinite number of twin primes.
