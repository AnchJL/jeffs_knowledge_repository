#Math/NumberTheory 

Amicable numbers are a pair of numbers where the sum of each number's divisors is equal to its partner number.

For example, 220 and 284 are amicable numbers the sum of divisors of 220 add up to 284 and the sum of divisors of 284 add up to 220. This is the lowest pair of amicable numbers.
