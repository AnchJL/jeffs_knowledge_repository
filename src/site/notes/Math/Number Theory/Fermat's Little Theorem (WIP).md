#Math/NumberTheory

Fermat's little theorem is as follows:

$x^p \equiv x \mod p \text{ (if p is prime)}$

For example, $2^5 \equiv 2 \mod 5$ since $2^5=32$ and both 32 and 2 have a remainder of 2 when you divide by 5 (in other words $32-2=30$ is divisible by 5).

Another way of writing the above theorem is:
$$
x^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \text{ {if x is not divisible by $p$}}
$$
