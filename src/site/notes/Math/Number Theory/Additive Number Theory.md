#Math/NumberTheory 
Additive number theory is a subset of number theory that studies the properties of integers when adding them together.

Some key concepts under additive number theory include:

- [[Math/Number Theory/Goldbach Conjecture\|Goldbach Conjecture]]
- [[Math/Number Theory/Twin Prime Conjecture\|Twin Prime Conjecture]]
- [[Dirichlet's Theorem\|Dirichlet's Theorem]]
## Goldbach Conjecture

Goldbach's conjecture is an unsolved problem that states that every even number greater than 4 is the sum of two primes. Although this appears to be the case and no counterexample has been found, Goldbach's conjecture remains to be proven.

Example even numbers that are the sum of two primes:
$6=3+3$
$12=5+7$
$32=19+13$

### Chen's Theorem

A weaker version of Goldbach's conjecture is known as Chen's Theorem, which states that every sufficiently large even number is equal to either (a) the sum of two primes or (b) the sum of a prime and a *semiprime* (which is a product of two primes).

$$
(N=p+qr) \text{ or }(N=p+q)
$$
Where N is an even number and p, q, and r are primes.

## Twin Prime Conjecture

A *twin prime* refers to any pair of prime numbers that have a difference of 2. Below are some examples of twin primes:
- 3 and 5 are twin primes, as are
- 5 and 7
- 11 and 13
- 17 and 19

The twin prime conjecture is an unsolved problem that asks whether there are an infinite number of twin primes.

## Arithmetic Progressions

5, 11, 17, 23, 29 are a series of primes that has a constant difference of 6 between them.
