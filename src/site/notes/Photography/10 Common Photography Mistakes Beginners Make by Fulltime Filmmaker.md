# Mistake #1: Focusing Too Much on the Gear

People get so hung up on gear and end up not taking photos because they believe their gear is not good enough.

Focus on learning and how to best use the gear you already have.

You can slowly upgrade your gear over time.

# Mistake #2: Using the Wrong Camera Settings

Mistakes that happen with shooting modes
- Don't be afraid to try other modes
- You need to learn the effects the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO has on the image

Manual mode is going to give you more creative control over your pictures
- Many rookies end up over exposing and blowing up highlights, or underexposing where you introduce unnecessary noise
- **Histogram** is a great exposure tool to understand how your image is being read by the camera
- When in doubt, better to *slightly under expose* because it is easier to lift the shadows during post-processing, than it is to reduce highlights from overexposed photos

## Shooting in JPEG instead of RAW

Shooting in the wrong white-balance can be fixed by shooting in raw

| JPEG                                                | RAW                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Compressed file (meaning there is information loss) | Uncompressed                                 |
| Bakes in settings                                   | Retain exposure and colour information       |
| Forced to set correct white balance                 | Shoot auto white balance                     |
| Cannot adjust shutter speed, aperture, focus        | Cannot adjust shutter speed, aperture, focus |
| Takes up less space on SD card                      | Takes up more space in SD card               |

Suppose you have an underexposed photo or have the wrong colour balance. 
- If your image was saved as a JPEG, then you will end up with weird colours and artifacts after post-processing because JPEGs retain your settings, while raw files retain more colour and exposure information
- Shooting raw photos can allow you to adjust white balance
- Cannot adjust shutter speed, aperture, and focus

# Mistake #3: Bad Composition

Knowing how to properly compose an image will vastly improve it

Beginners tend to not fill the frame with the subject
- Beginners instead tend to include too many **distracting** elements such as including too much background, foreground, other people and objects
- Including all these other things makes the viewer search for the subject of the photo, making it **lose impact and depth**
- This is especially common for portrait photos
- ![Pasted image 20240819013915.png](/img/user/Photography/Pasted%20image%2020240819013915.png)
	- Camera is too far away from the subject, and so the subject is too small in the frame.
	- Exception: you want the landscape to also be a subject of focus

Ensure that the background is not too distracting (ex: a photo where it appears a tree is growing from behind a person's head).
- Change your camera angle when needed,

## Remember to use the [[Visual Art/Rule of Thirds\|Rule of Thirds]]
- Taking a picture with the subject in the exact centre results in too much head room and cuts out their body at a weird position. See the example below
	- ![Pasted image 20240819014405.png](/img/user/Photography/Pasted%20image%2020240819014405.png)
- You want the face to be on the top intersections of the dividing lines, leaving room in front of their face. See example below:
	- ![Pasted image 20240819014546.png](/img/user/Photography/Pasted%20image%2020240819014546.png)
- If the subject is facing the camera, then you can center them in between the two vertical lines
	- ![Pasted image 20240819014733.png](/img/user/Photography/Pasted%20image%2020240819014733.png)

Lack of depth
- Most beginners take their photos in the open with no foreground. Find something to place in the foreground, or put your camera close to the ground to give the photo depth
- Try to find leading lines in fences, walls, and other objects to give the image depth.
- Be creative with your camera angles
- This mistake relates to choice of lenses

# Mistake #4: Bad Lighting

Good photographers are able to use and shape light

Many beginners take their subjects out at noon and have their subjects squint with the sun directly overhead. This gives the subject *racoon eyes*
- Try to take outdoor portraits when the sun is lower on the horizon during golden hour (1 hour before sunset or 1 hour after sunrise)
- If you do have to take photos at noon, you can bring a reflector or an on-counter flash
	- A common mistake done with this is that there is no modifier on the flash to soften the light
	- Bigger light sources, in relation to the subject, produce a softer light, which looks better. See picture below for reference
		- ![Pasted image 20240819015440.png](/img/user/Photography/Pasted%20image%2020240819015440.png)
	- Clouds help to diffuse sunlight, making the light softer on subjects and cast nice even shadows across the face of the subject
		- Putting a soft box over your flash works the same way
	- Use off-camera flash, make sure dial back the flash brightness so the subject is not too bright or too dark relative to their environment

If you don't have a flash or reflector, try to shoot photos during times of the day where there are clouds covering the sky or when the sun is lower
- Also be sure to use the sun as a backlight and not as a frontal light (see image below for reference)
	- ![Pasted image 20240819020257.png](/img/user/Photography/Pasted%20image%2020240819020257.png)

In studios, use a rim or hair light to avoid having the subject blending in with the background (there are some exceptions to thus, such as when you want to create a certain mood)

# Mistake #5: Soft Focus

Focus is an element of composition

If your host is out of focus, it will be unusable
1. Servo and One shot
	- Most cameras, by default, are set to one shot
		- The camera locks focus when the shutter button is half-pressed. The photo can become out of focus when the subject or camera moves in between the shutter button being half-pressed and the shutter button being fully pressed
		- To avoid this, change the camera setting to full servo. This tells the camera to keep adjusting focus until the photo is shot
2. Shaky frame
	- when the shutter is too low, and your subject moves, this can cause motion blur.
	- The appearance of motion blur can also be caused by camera movement/shakiness
	- Set your shutter speed to 1/250th of a second at a maximum
	- For photos depicting faster moving subjects, set your shutter speed to at least 1/100th of a second
3. Use of back button focus
	- Allows you to seamlessly switch focus modes between servo and one-shot
	- Keeping the button pressed turns on servo auto-focus. Tapping the button once switches to one shot and locks the focus in on still subjects

# Mistake #6: Lack of Movement or Action

Capturing movement, emotion, and action are what create a good photo

Beginner photographers worry too much about the pose, making them look staged. 
- Don't stage all of your shots. 
- Instruct your subjects to do something of interest (like walking). This will create authentic and candid moments.

Don't take photos just for the sake of it. Look for impactful moments to take pictures of.

You can use long-exposure photography to create movement in your photo (i.e. capture motion blur)

# Mistake #7: Using the Wrong Lens

Using a wide-angled lens on a close-up of someone's face
- See the two pictures below for a comparison of a up close picture of someone's face using a 16mm lens vs 100mm lens:
	- ![Pasted image 20240819022205.png](/img/user/Photography/Pasted%20image%2020240819022205.png)
	- ![Pasted image 20240819022235.png](/img/user/Photography/Pasted%20image%2020240819022235.png)
- For closeups, you want to use a lens with a focus in between 70mm to 100mm lens
- 50mm lens are good for medium portraits or 3/4 full body pictures, but not close ups

Use a wide-angled lens for group photos, full body photos, or when you want to focus more on the environment/background (think of landscape or architectural photos)

For sports photography, do not use a wide or standard lens. Use a telephoto lens.
- Allows you to zoom in when they are on the other side of the field
- This of course, depends on the sport, as some lenses are better suited to some sports but not others

# Mistake #8: Bad Posing

Make sure your subjects are comfortable in their poses

Look for candid expressions and authentic moments
- Instead of recreating a pose, instruct your subjects to do something that will naturally and organically create the right pose

Most people will not know how to pose good for a photo
- Lead and guide your subjects by using common vocabulary between them
	- Example: "hold each other like it is cold outside, and look at each other longingly"
1. Create a comfortable environment
2. Cause emotion and smiles
3. Inspire confidence

Guiding is generally better than posing

Have a good eye for detecting when your subjects are feeling stiff and uncomfortable

# Mistake #9: Overediting
\
It is very rare for a photo to be perfect prior to any processing

Signs you may be over processing your photos
- Too much saturation
- Plastic looking skin
- Over exposed in making a photo look bright and airy

Avoid making extreme changes to the following:
- Contrast
- Saturation
- Sharpening
- Clarity

Something can be "eye-catching" for the wrong reasons

# Mistake #10: Not Enough Reps

Focus more time on creating than consuming

To escape beginner status, take many shoots. Constantly take photos and learn from your mistakes.

Although it is good to learn from the professionals, it can be damaging to constantly compare yourself to them
- Compare yourself to who you were in the past
