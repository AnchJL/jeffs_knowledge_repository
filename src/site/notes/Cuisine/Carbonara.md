Ingredients:
- 300g of spaghetti or linguine (100g feeds one person)
- 200g of pecorino Romano and/or parmesan Reggiano
- 300g of guanciale or pancetta
- 3 eggs and 1 egg yolk
- black pepper

Instructions
1. Cut the skin off the guanciale/pancetta and then cut it into relatively thick slices. The reason we want thick slices is because the meat is very fatty and cooking it will shrink the fat
2. Finely grate the cheese into a bowl
3. Boil a pot of water
4. As the water is boiling, cook the sliced meet on a pan on low medium-low heat. No cooking oil required. Cook until crispy.
5. When the water boils, add a pinch of salt and then add the spaghetti.
6. Place 3 whole eggs and 1 egg yolk into a bowl. Place half of the grated cheese into the egg mixture and add a small amount of pasta water. Stir until the cheese is sufficiently melted and mixed. Add the rest of the grated cheese to the sauce and continue mixing. Add a very generous amount of pepper to the sauce
7. Using tongs or chopsticks, lace the noodles into the pan containing the guanciale/pancetta. Mix the noodles with the meat and grease.
8. Turn the stove off. Add the sauce into the noodles with a very small amount of pasta water if needed. Add a generous amount of pepper. Mix the noodles with the sauce. Avoid making scrambled eggs.
9. Serve with garnish (optional)
