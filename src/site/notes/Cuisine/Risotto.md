Ingredients
- 1 to 2 shallots (or 1/2 onion), finely diced
- 3 cloves of garlic, diced
- 4 1/2 cups of chicken stock
- 1 1/2 cups of arborio rice (or Carnaroli rice)

Instructions
1. Heat up the chicken stock to a boil and leave it aside
2. Add 2-3 tbs of olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add shallots and garlic, add salt, and saut√© for 3-4 minutes.
3. Add arborio rice. Toast the rice for 1-2 minutes. 
4. Add 1/2 cup of white wine to deglaze. Increase the heat to medium high. Stir until 90% evaporated.
5. Turn the heat back down to medium. Add half a ladle of the stock to the rice and keep stirring. As the stock evaporates, add another half a ladle full of stuck. Keep stirring.
6. Repeat the process until the rice is al dente, which should take anywhere between 15-25 minutes. Ensure the consistency is not too dry and that there is no crunchiness to it. It should like the rice is suspended to a thick custard that holds it all together
7. Turn off the heat. Add 2 tbs of unsalted butter. Add a third of a cup of grated cheese.
8. Place the risotto on a plate. Hit the bottom of the plate to make the risotto flat so it doesn't continue to cook in the center.
9. Add some more grated cheese and any additional garnish on top.
